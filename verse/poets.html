                    <div class="poem-text">
                        <p>The state of the world has been on my mind<br>
                            It's weighed on my shoulders, demanding my time<br>
                            Something is missing, it's hard to stay sane<br>
                            Why do the answers seem lost and arcane?</p>
                        
                        <p>May war stop once and for all<br>
                            And cast off the violence that has us enthralled<br>
                            May healing not just be for the few<br>
                            May peace be found for me and you</p>

                        <p>I speak of a message said thousands of times<br>
                            Yet we smile when it's mentioned and roll our eyes<br>
                            It may be naive, but I must believe<br>
                            Inside every human, there's kindness still</p>

                        <p>Hope is a fire that burns in us all<br>
                            If only an ember, awaiting your call<br>
                            To rise up in triumph should we all unite<br>
                            The spark for change is yours to ignite</p>

                        <p>I believe this message is worth our time<br>
                            There are people who've suffered yet conquered the climb<br>
                            Who've sat in the stillness through darkness and light<br>
                            And found love in the colours between black and white</p>

                        <p>May compassion turn foe into friend<br>
                            May self-awareness help us transcend<br>
                            May forgiveness be given, despite lives that were lost<br>
                            For isn't it peace all of us want?</p>

                        <p>The state of the world has been on my mind<br>
                            Demanding my conscience and all of my time<br>
                            Was there ever an age where it all made sense?<br>
                            Or am I reminiscing about lost innocence?</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>In Kalandra’s “The State of the World,” Katrine Stenbekk employs 
                        thought-provoking rhetorical questions and jarring diction to 
                        convey the confusion and moral complexity of the world around us 
                        today. She begins the song by stating that something feels wrong 
                        about the world and asks, “Why do the answers seem lost and 
                        arcane?” This sentiment reflects that of many disillusioned 
                        people today. Many people constantly witness corruption, war, 
                        and famine in the world and can only ponder the reason. By 
                        including this line, Stenbekk is able to connect with her 
                        audience while imploring them to keep those thoughts in their 
                        consciousness. She forces her audience to confront their own 
                        lack of answers.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the same way, it is startling when she states “May war stop 
                        once and for all / And cast off the violence that has us enthralled.” 
                        The first part of that verse is commonly heard enough to be known as 
                        cliche, yet the second part is jarring: violence is not often thought 
                        of as drawing us in. By paradoxically stating such, Stenbekk forces us 
                        to reconsider our relationship with violence. She reveals an uncomfortable 
                        truth: violence trends, kindness does not.
